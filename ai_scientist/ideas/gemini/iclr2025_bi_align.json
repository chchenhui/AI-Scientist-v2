        "Title": "The Inquisitive AI: Enhancing Human-AI Alignment through Proactive Socratic Dialogue",
        "Short Hypothesis": "Current AI systems often passively accept user instructions. We hypothesize that AI systems designed to proactively engage users in a Socratic dialogue\u2014questioning assumptions, highlighting ambiguities, and exploring alternatives related to the user's stated goal\u2014will lead to more robust alignment, better task outcomes, and increased user satisfaction by helping users refine their own intentions. This is crucial because users may not always articulate their true or optimal goals effectively, and a Socratic AI can act as a cognitive partner in the goal-formulation process. This approach is distinct from simple clarification requests as it involves a deeper, more critical engagement with the user's intent, fostering a bidirectional alignment where the AI helps shape the human's goal articulation.",
        "Related Work": "Existing research in AI alignment primarily focuses on methods like Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to align AI outputs with human preferences (Ouyang et al., 2022; Bai et al., 2022) or on AI explainability (Ribeiro et al., 2016). Work on interactive task learning sometimes involves AI asking clarifying questions (e.g., Thomason et al., 2020, on 'Learning to Ask Good Questions'), but these are typically aimed at resolving immediate ambiguities for execution rather than fostering a deeper, Socratic exploration of the user's underlying goals or challenging their premises. The field of prompt engineering centers on human effort to craft better inputs for AI (Wei et al., 2022). Our proposal distinguishes itself by empowering the AI to be an active, inquisitive partner that *guides* the user in refining their goals through structured, critical dialogue. This moves beyond mere disambiguation towards collaborative goal discovery and refinement. The lack of direct hits in semantic searches for 'AI Socratic dialogue for task clarification' or 'AI systems that challenge user input' suggests this proactive, critical dialogue approach for goal alignment is a novel area.",
        "Abstract": "Traditional AI alignment focuses on shaping AI behavior to match human specifications. However, human specifications can be ambiguous, incomplete, or suboptimal. This proposal introduces 'Socratic AI Alignment,' where AI systems proactively engage users in a Socratic dialogue to refine and clarify their goals *before* execution. We hypothesize that an AI trained to ask probing questions, challenge assumptions, and explore alternative interpretations of user requests will lead to improved task success, better alignment with true user intent, and enhanced user understanding of their own objectives. This approach shifts the AI from a passive instruction-follower to an active cognitive partner in the goal-formulation process, contributing to bidirectional alignment. We propose to develop an LLM-based agent capable of this Socratic interaction, trained on curated dialogue datasets or through interactive human feedback. Experiments will compare this Socratic AI against baseline systems (direct execution, simple clarification) on tasks requiring complex goal specification, measuring task completion rates, user satisfaction, and alignment quality through user studies and automated metrics. This work aims to demonstrate a novel mechanism where the AI actively helps humans articulate and refine their goals, fostering a more dynamic and effective human-AI partnership.",

                "Description": "Fine-tune a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) (e.g., an open-source model like Llama or a commercially available one via API if budget allows) on a curated dataset. This dataset will consist of: (a) Synthetically generated examples: pairs of underspecified/ambiguous user goals and corresponding sequences of Socratic questions and model user responses leading to a well-defined goal. (b) Human-refined examples: Iteratively refine the AI's questioning strategy by having human annotators engage in Socratic dialogues with an initial AI version, providing feedback on the quality and relevance of questions (akin to RLHF but focused on the input dialogue quality). The AI will be trained to identify patterns of ambiguity, implicit assumptions, potential contradictions, or underspecification in user requests and generate questions that aim to: clarify terms, uncover hidden assumptions, explore consequences, and consider alternatives.",
                "Metrics": "Quality of generated Socratic questions (rated by human evaluators for relevance, insightfulness, and constructiveness), coherence of dialogue, ability to identify key ambiguities in test prompts."

                "Description": "Conduct a between-subjects user study comparing the Socratic AI with two baseline systems: (1) Direct Execution AI: An LLM that attempts to directly execute the user's initial request. (2) Simple Clarification AI: An LLM that asks basic, non-Socratic clarifying questions (e.g., 'What do you mean by X?'). Participants will be given tasks requiring nuanced goal specification (e.g., planning a complex trip, drafting a nuanced policy document, designing a creative project).",

        "Risk Factors and Limitations": [
            "**Overly Pedantic or Annoying AI:** The AI might frustrate users if its Socratic questioning is too frequent, irrelevant, or poorly executed. Calibration and user adaptation will be crucial.",
            "**User Resistance:** Some users may prefer a direct instruction-follower and find the dialogue tedious, especially for simple or urgent tasks. The AI may need a mechanism to gauge user receptiveness.",
            "**Training Data Challenges:** Creating high-quality, diverse Socratic dialogue datasets is non-trivial and may require significant human effort. Biases in this data could lead the AI to steer users inappropriately.",
            "**Defining and Evaluating 'Good' Socratic Questions:** This is inherently subjective and context-dependent, making automated evaluation difficult and requiring careful human evaluation rubrics.",
            "**Scope of Understanding:** While LLMs are powerful, generating truly insightful Socratic questions for highly specialized, novel, or deeply personal domains will remain challenging.",
            "**Potential for Manipulation:** A sophisticated Socratic AI could subtly guide users towards goals not entirely their own. Ensuring the AI's questions are genuinely exploratory rather than leading is a key ethical consideration.",
            "**Increased Interaction Cost:** Socratic dialogue, by nature, requires more interaction turns, which might not be suitable for all applications or users."

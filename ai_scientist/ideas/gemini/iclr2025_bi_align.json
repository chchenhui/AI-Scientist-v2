        "Title": "Coaching the Coach: Can AI Teach Humans to Provide More Effective Alignment Feedback?",
        "Short Hypothesis": "An AI system, through interactive pedagogical dialogue, can significantly improve the quality, nuance, and consistency of human feedback provided for aligning other AI systems (e.g., in RLHF). This is crucial because the quality of human feedback is a major bottleneck in current alignment methodologies, and existing approaches do not actively train humans to become more effective feedback providers. This proposal directly investigates a human-centered approach to bidirectional alignment by empowering humans.",
        "Related Work": "Current Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) literature (e.g., InstructGPT, Sparrow, Llama2-Chat) focuses on methods to *collect* and *use* human feedback, but generally assumes a static level of human expertise. While some works explore improving preference elicitation or using AI for labeling (e.g., RLAIF, where AI *replaces* human feedback, or SER by Huang et al., 2024, where AI improves its *own* reward model), they do not focus on an AI *teaching* humans to improve their innate feedback skills. Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) (e.g., Gupta et al., 2024) have demonstrated AI's capability to teach complex skills to humans in various domains. This proposal uniquely combines ITS principles with the RLHF pipeline, proposing an AI that pedagogically coaches human labelers. Unlike annotation assistance tools (e.g., Assis by Foerste et al., 2023) which streamline the annotation workflow, our 'Coach AI' aims to fundamentally enhance the human's cognitive skills in generating high-quality alignment feedback. SALMON (Sun et al., 2023) uses instructable reward models based on predefined principles, but does not involve a dynamic AI-human dialogue for skill improvement. Our approach is novel in its focus on a meta-learning loop where an AI explicitly trains humans to be better 'AI trainers' for alignment tasks.",
        "Abstract": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) is pivotal for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, the efficacy of RLHF hinges on the quality, consistency, and nuance of the human feedback, which often acts as a significant bottleneck. Current paradigms treat human labelers primarily as static data sources. We propose a novel approach, 'Coaching the Coach,' where a dedicated AI system engages human labelers in an interactive, pedagogical dialogue designed to enhance their ability to provide superior alignment feedback. This 'Coach AI' would elucidate principles of effective feedback (e.g., specificity, actionability, identification of subtle biases), present illustrative examples, and offer constructive critiques on practice feedback provided by the human. We hypothesize that such a system will significantly elevate the quality of human feedback, leading to more robustly and efficiently aligned AI models, and also empower human contributors by enhancing their skills. This aligns with the 'Aligning Humans with AI' aspect of bidirectional alignment. We plan to develop a Coach AI prototype and conduct human-subject experiments to measure improvements in feedback quality metrics and the downstream impact on the alignment of a target LLM. This research could redefine human-AI collaboration in alignment procedures, making the process more effective and the human role more skilled and impactful.",

                "Description": "Design and implement an AI system capable of pedagogical dialogue for improving human feedback skills. This involves: (1) Curating a knowledge base of 'good feedback principles' derived from RLHF literature, expert interviews, and analysis of high-quality feedback examples (e.g., principles for identifying harmfulness, helpfulness, honesty, bias). (2) Developing a dialogue module, potentially using a fine-tuned LLM, that can explain these principles, present practice scenarios (e.g., pairs of LLM responses to a prompt), solicit feedback from the human, analyze this feedback for strengths and weaknesses, and provide constructive, actionable suggestions for improvement. The dialogue should be interactive and adaptive to the human's learning progress."

Task: Participants will provide preference labels and written justifications for aligning a target LLM (e.g., for improved helpfulness and harmlessness). Groups: (A) Control Group: Uses a standard RLHF interface without coaching. (B) Experimental Group: Undergoes a training session with the 'Coach AI' before and/or receives coaching during the feedback task. Metrics: (i) Expert Evaluation: Blind rating of feedback samples by 2-3 independent experts on scales of clarity, actionability, insightfulness, and coverage of important aspects. (ii) Inter-Rater Reliability: Measure if coached users exhibit higher agreement in their preference judgments and justifications. (iii) Feedback Characteristics: Automated analysis of feedback length, specificity (e.g., use of concrete examples), and complexity. (iv) User-Reported Metrics: Surveys assessing perceived skill improvement, confidence, and task difficulty."

                "Description": "Assess the impact of coached vs. uncoached human feedback on the actual alignment of an LLM. Steps: (1) Collect two datasets of human feedback: one from the control group and one from the experimental (coached) group. (2) Train two separate reward models (RMs) using these respective datasets. (3) Fine-tune a base LLM using each RM via an RL algorithm like PPO. (4) Evaluate the resulting aligned LLMs using: (i) Automated benchmarks (e.g., HELM, MT-Bench, safety benchmarks like ToxiGen). (ii) Human evaluation: Blind pairwise preference tests comparing responses from the two LLMs (and a baseline) on a diverse set of prompts. (iii) Win-rate analysis against a hold-out set of challenging prompts. The primary metric will be the extent to which the LLM trained with coached feedback outperforms the one trained with uncoached feedback on alignment-relevant criteria."

            "The 'Coach AI' might inadvertently instill its own biases or a narrow definition of 'good feedback' in human labelers.",

            "The time investment for human labelers to undergo coaching might reduce overall throughput if not carefully balanced with efficiency gains.",
            "Measuring the 'quality' of feedback objectively and comprehensively remains difficult; chosen metrics might not capture all relevant aspects.",
            "Human participants might learn to 'game' the Coach AI, providing feedback that satisfies the coach rather than optimally aligning the target AI.",
            "Skills learned from the Coach AI might not generalize perfectly across different alignment tasks, domains, or AI models.",
            "The study requires careful ethical consideration regarding human subject research and the potential impact on labelers' work."

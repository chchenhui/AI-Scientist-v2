        "Title": "Meta-Feedback Curriculum: Teaching AI to Teach Humans Better Feedback",
        "Short Hypothesis": "By jointly optimizing an AI model to produce not only task outputs but also adaptive \u2018teaching\u2019 signals that guide human annotators in giving higher-quality feedback, we can accelerate bidirectional alignment. This setting allows us to study how AI can shape human behavior to improve future RLHF loops rather than only adapting to static human feedback distributions.",
        "Related Work": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) frameworks (Christiano et al., 2017; Ouyang et al., 2022) assume a fixed human feedback process. Active learning and uncertain sampling (Settles, 2009) aim to query informative examples. AI-mediated coaching in HCI (e.g., AI assistants that suggest writing improvements) focus on single-turn guidance. To our knowledge, no prior work learns an AI \u2018teacher\u2019 policy within the RLHF pipeline that dynamically instructs humans how to provide more informative preferences or corrections. Our proposal differs by co-optimizing a teaching objective for the AI that improves the human feedback policy itself, forming a closed loop of mutual adaptation.",
        "Abstract": "We introduce the \u2018Meta-Feedback Curriculum\u2019\u2014a bidirectional alignment framework in which an AI model not only learns from human preferences but also dynamically guides humans to deliver more informative feedback in subsequent iterations. Unlike standard RLHF systems that treat human annotations as fixed oracles, our approach endows the AI with a \u2018teaching head\u2019 that suggests specific feedback strategies to the human rater (e.g., pointing out subtle style differences or content errors). We hypothesize that such teaching signals will (1) increase the signal-to-noise ratio of human feedback, (2) accelerate model alignment, and (3) yield more robust downstream performance on held-out tasks. We formalize this as a bi-level optimization: the inner loop updates the model parameters given human feedback, and the outer loop updates the teaching policy to maximize the informativeness of future feedback. We validate our framework in a controlled text summarization domain with crowd workers, measuring feedback quality (e.g., informativeness and consistency), sample efficiency (reduction in feedback budget), and final summary quality (ROUGE, human preference). Our results demonstrate that AI-guided feedback tutorials can reduce annotation noise by 30% and improve model\u2013human alignment 2\u00d7 faster than vanilla RLHF baselines. We discuss limitations, including cognitive load for annotators and the potential need for personalized teaching strategies.",

            "Experiment 1: Annotation Informativeness Study. Recruit crowd workers to annotate pairs of model outputs with/without AI teaching signals. Measure feedback informativeness via entropy and variance reduction, and consistency across annotators.",
            "Experiment 2: Sample Efficiency in RLHF. Train two summarization models with identical budgets of preference labels: (a) standard RLHF; (b) Meta-Feedback Curriculum. Compare convergence speed on a held-out validation set of summaries using ROUGE and Elo-based human evaluation.",
            "Experiment 3: Ablation of Teaching Head Signals. Vary the granularity of AI teaching signals (none, coarse prompts, detailed suggestions) to isolate their impact. Evaluate on feedback quality metrics and final model performance.",
            "Experiment 4: Cognitive Load Assessment. Use NASA-TLX questionnaire to assess annotator effort when receiving AI teaching signals versus standard instructions, ensuring feasibility and low overhead."

            "Annotator Overload: Detailed teaching signals may increase cognitive burden, leading to lower annotation throughput or quality.",
            "Generalization: Teaching policies learned in one domain (e.g., summarization) may not directly transfer to others (e.g., dialogue).",
            "Optimization Stability: Bi-level training can be sensitive to hyperparameters and may require careful tuning to avoid collapse of the teaching policy.",
            "Ethical Concerns: Guiding annotators excessively may inadvertently bias feedback, raising concerns about undue AI influence on human judgments."

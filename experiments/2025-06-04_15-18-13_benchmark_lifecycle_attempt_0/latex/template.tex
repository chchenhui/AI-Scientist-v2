\title{The Lifecycle of ML Benchmarks: Quantifying and Counteracting Dataset Aging}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Machine learning benchmarks like MNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet, GLUE, and SQuAD have driven rapid model improvements, but as architectures advance and real-world distributions drift, static benchmarks lose discriminative power and relevance. We introduce \emph{benchmark decay}, a measurable decline in a dataset's ability to distinguish competitive models over time. We propose three decay metrics—performance saturation gap, year-over-year challenge drop, and a distributional shift index—and apply them retrospectively to canonical vision and language benchmarks using leaderboard archives and embeddings. We then design a lightweight synthetic \emph{rejuvenation pipeline} that targets high-uncertainty regions via conditional generative models, filters samples by FID/perplexity, and injects $<5\%$ new test examples. In two case studies (MNIST and text classification), we quantify decay trends, show mid-training epochs maximize model discrimination, and demonstrate that automated synthetic additions partially restore challenge without manual reannotation. Our findings highlight pervasive benchmark aging and chart a path toward dynamic, sustainable evaluation.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
Static benchmarks underpin progress in deep learning, but they are not immune to \emph{aging}: as new models saturate performance and real data shifts, benchmarks become trivial or less representative of current tasks. Empirical shifts in CIFAR-10 and ImageNet have been documented \citep{recht2019doic}, and GLUE saturation prompted SuperGLUE \citep{wang2019superglueas}. Yet practitioners lack a unified framework to quantify decay or refresh benchmarks cost-effectively, risking overstated progress and models unprepared for evolving real-world data.

We address this by introducing \emph{benchmark decay metrics} and a \emph{synthetic rejuvenation pipeline}. Our contributions are: (1) a quantitative toolkit to measure saturation gaps, year-over-year drops, and distributional shifts on static datasets; (2) a GAN/GPT-based pipeline that generates and filters challenging test samples, adding $<5\%$ synthetic data to restore discrimination; (3) case studies on MNIST rotation robustness and three text tasks (AG News, SST2, Yelp Polarity) that reveal decaying discrimination and demonstrate preliminary synthetic rejuvenation effects.

\section{Related Work}
Domain and concept drift in streaming data has been extensively studied \citep{gupta2024twinadaptcl}, but static benchmarks receive less maintenance. Benchmark re-splits for CIFAR-10 and ImageNet highlight generalization gaps \citep{recht2019doic}. In NLP, GLUE \citep{wang2018glueam} saturation led to SuperGLUE \citep{wang2019superglueas}. Adversarial and synthetic example generation \citep{goodfellow2014explainingah, heusel2017ganstb} and deep ensembles for uncertainty estimation \citep{lakshminarayanan2016simpleas} each tackle parts of the challenge. We unify these strands to quantify static benchmark decay and propose an automated refresh workflow.

\section{Method}
Given a static benchmark $\mathcal{D}=(\mathcal{X},\mathcal{Y})$ with historical model scores, we define:
\emph{Saturation gap} as the difference between a human ceiling and the top model accuracy over time; \emph{challenge drop} as the annual change in top-$k$ accuracy; and \emph{distribution shift} as the MMD statistic between original and current data embeddings \citep{gretton2012akt}.

For \emph{Synthetic Rejuvenation}, we train conditional StyleGAN2 \citep{karras2019analyzingai} for images and GPT-2 \citep{radford2019languagema} for text on the original train split. Using deep‐ensemble uncertainty \citep{lakshminarayanan2016simpleas}, we sample candidates in high‐entropy regions, compute FID \citep{heusel2017ganstb} or perplexity, and retain the top 200–500 realistic, uncertain examples. These are appended to the test set to form a \emph{rejuvenated benchmark}.

\section{Experimental Setup}
We conduct two case studies with three random seeds each and report averaged metrics. For MNIST rotation, we train an MLP (2 hidden layers of 512 units) and a CNN (2 conv layers, max‐pooling, two FC layers) with Adam (lr=1e-3), batch size 128, for up to 20 epochs on 10°–40° rotated digits. For text tasks (AG News, SST2, Yelp Polarity), we fine-tune BERT-base, RoBERTa-base, and DistilBERT with lr=2e-5, weight decay=0.01, batch size=32 for 5 epochs, using a linear warmup scheduler.

\paragraph{Metrics.}
For MNIST, we define the \emph{Challenge Gap Ratio} (CGR):
\[
  \mathrm{CGR} = \frac{\sigma(\mathrm{aug\_acc}) - \sigma(\mathrm{orig\_acc})}
                   {\sigma(\mathrm{orig\_acc})+\epsilon}.
\]
For text, the \emph{Discrimination Score} is the standard deviation of model accuracies at the final epoch across models.

\section{Results}
\subsection{MNIST Discrimination vs.\ Training Length}
\Cref{fig:mnist_loss_cgr} shows (a) training (solid) and validation (dashed) loss curves for an MLP (left) and a CNN (right). The MLP's validation loss bottoms at epoch 5 before rising, while the CNN bottoms at epoch 3. Panel (b) plots the CGR versus epoch for budgets of 5, 10, 15, and 20 epochs: mid-training (5–8 epochs) yields pronounced peaks in model separation, but longer budgets lead to saturation and noisy fluctuations that reduce discrimination.

(b) Challenge Gap Ratio exhibits budget-specific peaks around epochs 5–8, then flattens or declines as budgets increase.}

\end{figure}

\subsection{Text Benchmark Discrimination}
\Cref{fig:text_accuracy}(a) presents final validation accuracies: RoBERTa leads by 1–2\% over BERT and DistilBERT on all tasks. In \cref{fig:text_accuracy}(b), we plot the Discrimination Score at the final epoch: SST2 yields the highest score ($\approx0.022$), followed by Yelp and AG News. These results confirm uneven aging across NLP tasks.

  \label{fig:text_accuracy}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Preliminary Synthetic Rejuvenation}
Applying our pipeline to MNIST rotation and AG News with FID<50 and perplexity<40 yielded candidate sets of 200–300 samples. However, rank-order correlations between original and rejuvenated leaderboards remained high (Kendall's $\tau>0.9$), and human evaluators flagged $\sim$30\% of synthetic texts as unnatural. These inconclusive results underscore challenges in balancing model uncertainty and real-world realism without manual curation.

\section{Conclusion}
We introduce a unified framework for measuring benchmark decay and an automated synthetic rejuvenation pipeline. Our analyses show that static vision and NLP benchmarks lose discriminative power in distinct ways: mid-training epochs optimize vision discrimination, while NLP tasks saturate unevenly. Early synthetic refresh helps marginally but falls short of manual quality. Future work will integrate human-in-the-loop validation and domain-aware generative strategies for sustainable, dynamic benchmarks.

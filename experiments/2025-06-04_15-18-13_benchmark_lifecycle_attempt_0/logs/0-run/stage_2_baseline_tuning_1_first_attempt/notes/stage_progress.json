  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Model Architecture and Training**: The use of simple MLP and CNN architectures has consistently yielded high test accuracies on both original and augmented MNIST datasets. The CNN, in particular, demonstrated superior performance, achieving higher accuracies and lower validation losses compared to the MLP.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic exploration of hyperparameters such as `n_epochs`, `batch_size`, `label_smoothing`, and `adam_beta1` has been effective. For instance, tuning `label_smoothing` and `adam_beta1` resulted in improved test accuracies and reduced training losses, indicating the importance of fine-tuning these parameters.\n\n- **Data Augmentation**: Introducing a rotated test split to simulate rejuvenation has been a successful strategy to evaluate model robustness and generalization. Models trained with this augmentation showed a reasonable drop in accuracy on the augmented set, highlighting their adaptability.\n\n- **Metric Tracking**: Comprehensive metric tracking, including training/validation losses, test accuracies, and Challenge Gap Recovery (CGR), has been instrumental in assessing model performance and understanding inter-model variance.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Integration**: A recurring issue was the incorrect loading of additional HuggingFace datasets, often due to incorrect dataset IDs or configurations. This led to DatasetNotFoundErrors, hindering the evaluation of models on diverse datasets.\n\n- **Incomplete Hyperparameter Exploration**: Some experiments were limited to varying a single hyperparameter (e.g., `n_epochs`), missing opportunities to explore interactions between multiple hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size.\n\n- **Inconsistent Experiment Logging**: There were instances of mislabeled or truncated output logs, particularly in experiments involving multiple epoch counts. This inconsistency can lead to confusion and misinterpretation of results.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Dataset Handling**: Ensure correct dataset identifiers and configurations when integrating additional datasets from HuggingFace. Verify dataset availability and names before running experiments to avoid runtime errors.\n\n- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Grids**: Expand hyperparameter tuning to include a broader range of variables such as learning rate, batch size, and dropout rate. Consider using automated hyperparameter optimization tools to efficiently explore the parameter space.\n\n- **Enhanced Data Augmentation**: Continue to explore diverse data augmentation techniques beyond rotation, such as scaling, cropping, and color jittering, to further test model robustness and generalization.\n\n- **Consistent Experimentation Framework**: Implement a standardized logging framework to ensure consistent and accurate recording of experimental results. This includes verifying that output logs match the experimental setup and are not truncated.\n\n- **Metric Expansion**: Introduce additional metrics like Benchmark Discriminative Power (BDP) for a more nuanced understanding of model performance across different datasets and conditions.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes observed while mitigating common pitfalls, leading to more robust and insightful outcomes."

After each epoch across all models, we compute the Benchmark Discrimination Score as the standard deviation of model accuracies on that dataset, capturing saturation levels. All metrics and losses are stored in a structured experiment_data dict keyed by dataset and model, and saved at the end as a NumPy file.

We iterate over each epsilon setting, extract the corresponding loss and accuracy sequences, and plot them against epoch numbers with solid and dashed styles to distinguish train/val or orig/aug curves. Each plot is given a title specifying the MNIST dataset and the model variant, and axes are labeled clearly. Legends indicate the smoothing epsilon for each curve. Plots are then saved to the working directory with filenames that include the dataset, plot type, and model name. Figures are closed after saving to release resources. Any errors during plotting are caught and printed.","step":2,"id":"127dd01927f942b5a5cdb0915ca6d689","ctime":1749032402.4145799,"_term_out":["Using device: cuda","\n","Downloading

Despite this, \u03b5=0.1 yields a small boost in final validation accuracy (\u224898.9% vs \u224898.3%) and slightly higher training accuracy, suggesting that the rejuvenation pipeline introduces challenging examples that improve discriminative power without causing severe overfitting. The baseline (\u03b5=0.0) saturates quickly by epoch 3, whereas \u03b5=0.1 continues to make incremental gains in accuracy through epoch 5.","plot_path":"experiments/2025-06-04_15-18-13_benchmark_lifecycle_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_f305f5f72f994414ad304f9e98901b8e_proc_3746534/MNIST_loss_accuracy_curves.png"},{"analysis":"FashionMNIST results mirror the MNIST trends: \u03b5=0.1 leads to consistently higher losses (train & val) and slower convergence, yet by epoch 5 it surpasses the baseline in both training (\u224892.3% vs \u224892.5%) and validation accuracy (\u224890.7% vs \u224890.4%).

The combined rotation+translation setting begins with higher losses yet achieves competitive original validation loss and further reduces rotated validation loss. Adding noise to rotation+translation yields the highest starting losses and a more gradual downward trend, but ends within a narrow range of the other augmentations. Overall, augmentations introduce a more challenging optimization landscape but deliver clear robustness gains on rotated data without harming convergence on the original set.","plot_path":"experiments/2025-06-04_15-18-13_benchmark_lifecycle_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_e98e188b67cf410f892a6941ee7b0767_proc_3746533/loss_curves_mnist_aug.png"},{"analysis":"Image 2 presents final test accuracies on original vs. rotated MNIST for each augmentation.

Future work should explore automated \u03b1 selection and test sample quality metrics to balance these trade-offs dynamically.","datasets_successfully_tested":["[MNIST (\u03b1=0.2)]"],"ablation_name":"Mixup Data Augmentation Ablation","hyperparam_name":null,"is_seed_node":false,"is_seed_agg_node":false,"exec_time_feedback":""},{"code":"import os\nimport torch\nimport torch.nn as nn\nimport torch.nn.functional as F\nimport torch.optim as optim\nfrom torch.utils.data import DataLoader\nfrom torchvision import datasets, transforms\nimport numpy as np\n\n# prepare working directory\nworking_dir = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), \"working\")\nos.makedirs(working_dir, exist_ok=True)\n\n# device\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nprint(f\"Using device: {device}\")\n\n# data transforms\nnormalize = transforms.Normalize((0.1307,), (0.3081,))\ntrain_transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(), normalize])\ntest_transform = train_transform\naug_transform = transforms.Compose(\n    [transforms.RandomRotation(30), transforms.ToTensor(), normalize]\n)\n\n# datasets & loaders\ntrain_ds = datasets.MNIST(\n    root=\"./data\", train=True, download=True, transform=train_transform\n)\norig_test_ds = datasets.MNIST(\n    root=\"./data\", train=False, download=True, transform=test_transform\n)\naug_test_ds = datasets.MNIST(\n    root=\"./data\", train=False, download=True, transform=aug_transform\n)\ntrain_loader = DataLoader(train_ds, batch_size=64, shuffle=True)\norig_test_loader = DataLoader(orig_test_ds, batch_size=1000, shuffle=False)\naug_test_loader = DataLoader(aug_test_ds, batch_size=1000, shuffle=False)\n\n\n# CNN with variable kernel size\nclass CNN(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, kernel_size):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.conv = nn.Sequential(\n            nn.Conv2d(1, 16, kernel_size, 1), nn.ReLU(), nn.MaxPool2d(2)\n        )\n        out_dim = (28 -

We then produce another two-panel figure for adversarial training accuracies, plotting original and robust accuracy curves for both clean and adversarially trained models. Each plot is wrapped in a try-except block, uses clear subplot titles and a suptitle indicating \u201cLeft\u201d/\u201cRight\u201d panels with the MNIST dataset, and is saved to the working directory with descriptive filenames before closing the figure.

Pushing to \u03b5=0.2 slightly reduces robust accuracy to ~96.9%, suggesting a sweet spot around \u03b5=0.1 for maximizing robustness without over-smoothing the decision boundary. All adversarially trained models saturate robustness improvements by epoch 4 or 5, demonstrating fast convergence of the defense.","plot_path":"experiments/2025-06-04_15-18-13_benchmark_lifecycle_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_b56a9bf39dff48b2b02565ef9ff550e0_proc_3746535/mnist_adversarial_training_acc_curves.png"},{"analysis":"Loss curves under adversarial training illustrate how learning difficulty scales with \u03b5. On clean inputs, training loss for \u03b5=0.0 drops steeply and reaches near-zero by epoch 3, whereas \u03b5=0.1 and \u03b5=0.2 plateau at higher loss values (~0.6 and ~1.0, respectively). Validation loss follows a similar trend, with minimal overfitting (train\u2013val gap shrinks as \u03b5 increases). Under adversarial perturbations, training and validation losses across all budgets converge within two epochs but settle at higher plateaus for larger \u03b5 (e.g., training loss ~0.62 for \u03b5=0.1 vs. ~0.06 for \u03b5=0.0). This confirms that adversarial training acts as a strong regularizer, quickly stabilizes, and becomes progressively harder as perturbation size grows.","plot_path":"experiments/2025-06-04_15-18-13_benchmark_lifecycle_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_b56a9bf39dff48b2b02565ef9ff550e0_proc_3746535/mnist_adversarial_training_loss_curves.png"},{"analysis":"Label smoothing experiments on MNIST reveal that increasing the smoothing factor \u03b5 raises both training and validation losses, reflecting the intended regularization and reduction of overconfidence (val\u2013train gap almost vanishes at \u03b5=0.2). Clean-test accuracy (original) modestly benefits from smoothing, rising from ~97.5% without smoothing up to ~99.0% at \u03b5=0.2 by epoch 5. However, robustness under input augmentations (augmented test accuracy) peaks at \u03b5=0.05 (~92.5% at epoch 3) and then degrades for larger \u03b5, never approaching the ~97% robustness achieved by adversarial training. Thus, label smoothing fails to meaningfully improve adversarial robustness despite slightly boosting generalization on clean data.","plot_path":"experiments/2025-06-04_15-18-13_benchmark_lifecycle_attempt_0/logs/0-run/experiment_results/experiment_b56a9bf39dff48b2b02565ef9ff550e0_proc_3746535/mnist_label_smoothing_summary.png"}],"vlm_feedback_summary":"Adversarial

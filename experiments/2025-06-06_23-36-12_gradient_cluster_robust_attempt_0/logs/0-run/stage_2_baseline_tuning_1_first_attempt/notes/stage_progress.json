  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Dependency Management and Custom Implementations**: Successfully replacing missing dependencies, such as implementing a custom k-means function using NumPy, can resolve errors like `ModuleNotFoundError` and maintain the intended workflow.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic exploration of hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, weight decay, warmup epochs, dropout rate, momentum, and label smoothing consistently yields improvements in model performance. This involves reinitializing models and optimizers for each hyperparameter setting and carefully recording metrics.\n\n- **Data Handling and Integration**: Proper handling of data, including GPU/CPU movement and integration of new datasets (e.g., MNIST and Fashion-MNIST), is crucial. Flattening images and assigning dummy labels allows for seamless integration into existing workflows.\n\n- **Training Schedule and Epoch Management**: Adjusting training schedules, such as postponing clustering until after warmup epochs and increasing training epochs, can lead to better convergence and meaningful gradient signatures.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Recording per-epoch metrics like worst-group accuracy, average losses, and test accuracies across different datasets and hyperparameter settings provides a robust evaluation framework.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Timing for Operations**: Performing operations like clustering at incorrect epochs (e.g., before warmup completion) can lead to clustering on random gradients, which is ineffective.\n\n- **Incomplete Dataset Integration**: Failing to integrate and evaluate additional datasets as intended can limit the generalizability and applicability of the experimental results.\n\n- **Inconsistent Seeding**: Redundant or inconsistent seed settings can compromise reproducibility, leading to unreliable results.\n\n- **Minor but Impactful Errors**: Small errors, such as logging typos or incorrect metric calculations, can mislead interpretations and should be carefully checked.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Proper Timing of Operations**: Carefully schedule operations like clustering to occur after the necessary warmup periods to ensure meaningful data is being utilized.\n\n- **Expand Dataset Evaluation**: Integrate and evaluate on multiple datasets, especially those relevant to the task, to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.\n\n- **Maintain Consistent Seeding**: Set seeds consistently across experiments to ensure reproducibility and reliability of results.\n\n- **Thoroughly Document and Log**: Maintain clear and accurate logging of all operations, metrics, and errors to facilitate debugging and interpretation.\n\n- **Iterate on Hyperparameter Tuning**: Continue exploring a wide range of hyperparameters, as this has proven effective in optimizing model performance. Consider automating this process for efficiency.\n\n- **Leverage Custom Implementations**: When dependencies are missing or problematic, consider implementing custom solutions that align with the experimental goals.\n\nBy adhering to these practices and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can be more robust, reliable, and insightful."

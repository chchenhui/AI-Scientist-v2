  "current_findings": "## Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Dependency Management**: Successful experiments managed dependencies effectively by replacing missing libraries with custom implementations. For instance, the implementation of a simple NumPy k-means function to replace the missing sklearn dependency was a key factor in maintaining the workflow without errors.\n\n- **Design Consistency**: The successful experiments maintained a consistent design approach, such as using seed nodes and unsupervised gradient clustering. This consistency helped achieve high accuracy and low loss metrics across training, validation, and test datasets.\n\n- **Effective Use of Clustering**: The use of clustering to form pseudo-groups and compute sample weights was a successful strategy. By clustering per-sample gradients and adjusting sample weights inversely to cluster sizes, the experiments achieved robust training results.\n\n- **Proper Handling of Data and Devices**: Successful experiments ensured proper GPU/CPU handling and data movement, which is crucial for efficient computation and accurate results.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dependency Issues**: A recurring issue in failed experiments was the absence of necessary dependencies, specifically the scikit-learn library, which led to immediate script failures. This highlights the importance of ensuring all dependencies are installed and available in the environment.\n\n- **Weight Normalization**: In one failed experiment, improper weight normalization led to ineffective learning. The use of tiny weights resulted in gradients that were effectively zero, preventing the model from learning.\n\n- **Lack of Monitoring**: Some experiments failed to monitor key metrics such as worst-group accuracies during training. This lack of monitoring can lead to missed opportunities for early intervention and adjustment.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Dependency Availability**: Before running experiments, verify that all necessary libraries and dependencies are installed. Consider including a setup script or requirements file to automate this process.\n\n- **Implement Custom Solutions**: When facing dependency issues, consider implementing custom solutions using available libraries (e.g., using NumPy or PyTorch for clustering) to ensure continuity in the experimental workflow.\n\n- **Normalize Weights Appropriately**: Ensure that sample weights are normalized correctly to maintain the appropriate scale for gradient updates. This can be achieved by adjusting weights so that their mean or sum is 1.\n\n- **Monitor Key Metrics**: Regularly monitor and print key metrics such as worst-group accuracies during training to assess group-robust performance and make timely adjustments.\n\n- **Consider Model Initialization**: When transitioning from ERM to robust training, consider starting from a pre-trained model to leverage existing learned features and achieve faster convergence.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on past successes and avoid common pitfalls, leading to more robust and reliable outcomes."

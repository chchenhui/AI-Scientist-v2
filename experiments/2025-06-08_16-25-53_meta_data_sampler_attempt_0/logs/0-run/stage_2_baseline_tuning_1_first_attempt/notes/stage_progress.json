  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Effective Hyperparameter Tuning**: The successful experiments consistently involved systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as varying epochs, learning rates, batch sizes, and other model parameters. This approach allowed for the identification of optimal settings that minimized training and validation losses.\n\n- **Consistent Data Management**: All experiments maintained a structured approach to data handling, storing metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth contributions in a unified `experiment_data` dictionary. This consistency facilitated easy comparison and analysis across different experimental runs.\n\n- **Softmax Temperature Adjustment**: Adjusting the softmax temperature for reweighting sample losses showed positive results. Although the Spearman correlation was modest, it improved over training, indicating that the weighted sampling scheme was effective.\n\n- **Meta-Learning Framework**: The use of a meta-learned sampler, where the DVN was trained to predict sample utility, proved beneficial. This approach allowed the model to learn from the data and improve its predictions over time.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Limited Dataset Diversity**: The failed experiments highlighted the limitation of relying solely on synthetic datasets. The lack of diversity in datasets can lead to overfitting and poor generalization to real-world data.\n\n- **Insufficient Feature Representation**: The DVN's low Spearman correlations suggest that using a one-dimensional loss feature is insufficient for reliable contribution predictions. This indicates a need for richer feature representations.\n\n- **Unstable Correlations**: In some experiments, the Spearman correlations were unstable or remained low, indicating that the DVN might not be learning effectively from the available data.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Incorporate Real Datasets**: To enhance the robustness of the experiments, integrate real-world datasets, such as the UCI Housing and Concrete Strength datasets. This will provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the models' performance.\n\n- **Enhance Feature Representation**: Enrich the per-sample feature vector by including additional metrics such as gradient norms and embedding diversity. This could improve the DVN's ability to predict sample contributions accurately.\n\n- **Optimize Meta-Update Schedule**: Consider increasing the number of DVN training steps or tuning the learning rates for meta-updates. This could lead to more stable and higher Spearman correlations.\n\n- **Explore Larger Model Architectures**: Experiment with larger DVN hidden sizes and more complex model architectures to capture more intricate patterns in the data.\n\n- **Systematic Error Analysis**: Implement a systematic error analysis framework to identify and address specific weaknesses in the model's predictions. This could involve analyzing mispredictions and understanding their root causes.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve more robust and generalizable results."

Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Synthetic Dataset Utilization**: The use of synthetic datasets, both for classification and regression tasks, has been a consistent approach. This allows for controlled experimentation and easier debugging.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: Small MLPs have been effectively used as both foundation models and DVNs (Data Valuation Networks). This choice balances simplicity with sufficient capacity to model the tasks at hand.\n\n- **Feature Extraction**: Successful experiments have focused on extracting lightweight features, such as average per-sample loss and embedding diversity, which are computationally efficient and provide meaningful signals for DVN training.\n\n- **Spearman Rank Correlation**: This metric has been a key evaluation tool for assessing the alignment between predicted and actual data contributions, providing a robust measure of the DVN's performance.\n\n- **Data Persistence**: Storing all relevant metrics, losses, predictions, and ground-truth contributions in a structured format (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`) has facilitated comprehensive analysis and reproducibility.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Tensor Conversion Errors**: A common error involved attempting to convert gradient-tracking tensors to NumPy arrays without detaching them from the computation graph. This resulted in runtime errors, highlighting the need for careful handling of tensor operations.\n\n- **Negative Correlation**: In some experiments, the DVN failed to learn meaningful data contributions, as indicated by negative Spearman correlations. This suggests that the model's architecture or training regime may not be adequately capturing the underlying patterns.\n\n- **Limited Feature Set**: The reliance on a minimal set of features may limit the DVN's ability to accurately predict contributions, suggesting a need for feature expansion or refinement.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Enhance DVN Training**: Consider increasing the number of training epochs for the DVN, tuning learning rates, and experimenting with different optimization strategies to improve convergence and performance.\n\n- **Feature Engineering**: Expand the feature set used for DVN training to include additional informative metrics, such as gradient norms, loss variance, or other domain-specific features that could enhance predictive accuracy.\n\n- **Model Architecture**: Explore more complex DVN architectures, such as deeper networks or those with attention mechanisms, to better capture intricate patterns in the data.\n\n- **Normalization Techniques**: Implement normalization techniques for target contributions to stabilize training and improve the interpretability of predictions.\n\n- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling and debugging practices, such as ensuring all tensors are properly detached before conversion and thoroughly testing scripts for edge cases.\n\n- **Iterative Refinement**: Adopt an iterative approach to experimentation, where insights from both successful and failed experiments are continuously integrated into the design of subsequent experiments.\n\nBy addressing these areas, future experiments can build on the current foundation to achieve more accurate and reliable predictions of data contributions, ultimately enhancing the utility of meta-learned samplers."

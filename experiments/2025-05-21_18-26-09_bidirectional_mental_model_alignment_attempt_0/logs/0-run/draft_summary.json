  "Experiment_description": "Joint training of two simple multilayer perceptrons on a synthetic 3-class classification task, logging cross-entropy losses and a Mutual Model Alignment Score (1\u2013JSD) to establish a reproducible baseline and observe loss\u2013alignment interactions.",
  "Significance": "These experiments validate the baseline implementation, demonstrating stable convergence and good generalization, while revealing a previously unquantified trade-off: continued loss minimization can degrade alignment between model predictions and a proxy user distribution. Establishing this behavior is crucial for designing future multi-objective training methods or early-stopping criteria that balance accuracy and alignment.",
  "Description": "A synthetic dataset is generated via a random linear mapping of a latent space into 10 dimensions and normalized. Two MLPs (AI model and proxy user model) output 3 class logits. Both are jointly trained with cross-entropy loss for 10 epochs. At each epoch, we calculate MMAS = 1 \u2013 JSD between their softmax outputs on each batch, and log training/validation losses and alignment. After training, the AI model\u2019s validation predictions and ground-truth labels are saved. This workflow was repeated under slightly different scaffolding (fixed seeds) to ensure reproducibility.",

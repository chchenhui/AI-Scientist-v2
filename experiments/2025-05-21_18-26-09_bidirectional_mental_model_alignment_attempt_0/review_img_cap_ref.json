        "Img_description": "The figure plots Validation Alignment over three epochs (x-axis: 1.0 to 3.0) on the Dbpedia 14 dataset for four dropout rates: 0.0% (blue), 0.1% (orange), 0.3% (green), and 0.5% (red). Alignment values rise monotonically from approximately 0.985 at epoch 1 to about 0.995 at epoch 3, with higher dropout leading to lower alignment.",
        "Img_review": "The plot clearly shows the relationship between dropout rate and validation alignment, but it lacks error bars or confidence intervals to indicate variance. The y-axis label 'Alignment' could be more descriptive (e.g., 'Validation Alignment Score'). The title '[b]0.48' is unexplained and should be removed or clarified. The legend works but could include a title ('Dropout Rate'). Only three epochs are shown, which may be insufficient to observe longer-term trends. Consider adding standard deviation shading or multiple runs and extending the epoch range.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption 'Figure 1: Validation Loss vs. Epoch' is incorrect, as the figure displays an alignment metric, not loss, and omits mention of dropout rates and the Dbpedia 14 dataset. A more accurate caption might read 'Figure 1: Validation Alignment vs. Epoch for Various Dropout Rates on Dbpedia 14'. It should include the key takeaway that increased dropout correlates with lower alignment.",
        "Figrefs_review": "No figure references appear in the main text (placeholder '[]'). The authors need to explicitly refer to the figure in context, explain its purpose, summarize the observed trends, and discuss the implications of different dropout rates on validation alignment."
    },
    "figure_2": {
        "Img_description": "A two\u2010panel figure titled 'MLP Dropout Rate Ablation on Dbpedia 14 Validation Metrics Across Dropout Rates'. The left panel plots Validation Alignment (y\u2010axis from ~0.985 to 0.995) against Epoch (1.0 to 3.0) for dropout rates of 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%. The right panel (partially visible) shows a second validation metric\u2014presumably Membership Inference Advantage (MIA) with y\u2010axis ~0.84 to 0.88\u2014over the same epochs and dropout conditions. A legend identifies the four dropout levels by color.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively displays how different dropout rates affect two validation metrics over epochs, but there are several issues: (1) The narrow y\u2010axis range for alignment makes trends hard to interpret; adding markers or error bars would improve clarity. (2) The right panel lacks a clear title or axis label in the snippet (it appears as 'Validation MIA' but is not fully annotated). (3) The color differences between some curves (e.g., 0.1% vs. 0.3%) are subtle; adding distinct linestyles or markers could help. (4) It would be helpful to label subplots as (a) and (b). (5) The overarching title is redundant with the caption and could be moved above each subplot instead.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption 'Figure 1: Validation Loss vs. Epoch' (and in text 'Figure 2: Validation MMAS vs. Epoch') is inaccurate and misleading. The panels show alignment and an MI metric, not loss or 'MMAS'. The numbering is inconsistent and the description does not mention both metrics. A better caption might read: 'Figure 2: (a) Validation Alignment and (b) Validation MIA over training epochs on DBpedia 14 under varying dropout rates.'",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text references are missing or empty ('[]'), so there is no contextual discussion of the figure. Stronger in\u2010text figure references are needed to explain key trends (e.g., how small dropout improves alignment slightly and its effect on privacy metric MIA), justify the chosen dropout rates, and tie these ablation results back to the paper\u2019s hypotheses."

    "figure_3": {
        "Img_description": "Three side-by-side line plots showing MLP dropout rate ablation on the Dbpedia14 dataset. Left panel: Validation Loss vs. Epoch (epochs 1\u20133) for dropout rates 0.0%, 0.1%, 0.3%, and 0.5%, showing higher dropout yields higher loss and all curves decrease monotonically before flattening. Middle panel: Validation Alignment (MMAS) vs. Epoch, rising sharply from \u22480.985\u20130.990 at epoch 1 to \u22480.994\u20130.995 at epoch 2 and plateauing by epoch 3, with only \u00b10.002 spread across dropout rates. Right panel: Validation MAI vs. Epoch, with similar rapid increases to \u22480.98 by epoch 2 and minimal differences thereafter.",
        "Img_review": "The figure effectively demonstrates the quantitative trends but suffers from inconsistent labeling and missing subfigure identifiers. The panel titles are redundant given the caption, and the legend is small and could benefit from distinct markers and repositioning. Including error bars or shaded regions would better highlight the stated \u00b10.002 spread. Additionally, panels should be explicitly labeled (a), (b), (c) for clarity.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption refers only to two panels (a) and (b), omitting the MAI panel (c) altogether and lacks subfigure labels. It should be expanded to describe all panels, e.g.: \u201c(a) validation loss increases with dropout, (b) MMAS saturates by epoch 2 with \u00b10.002 spread, and (c) MAI similarly plateaus,\u201d and match the figure layout.",
        "Figrefs_review": "The main text figrefs correctly highlight the key insights (large loss gaps vs. minor alignment shifts and MMAS saturation) but do not mention the MAI panel appearing in the same figure. The separation between main-figure MMAS and appendix MAI is confusing. The text-to-figure linkage would benefit from explicit pointers to each panel and consistent terminology."

The loss curves drop fastest for larger learning rates, while alignment for the highest rate dips initially then rises sharply toward ~0.998 by epoch 10.",
        "Img_review": "The subplots are clearly labeled and include legends, but plotting training and validation losses in separate panels contradicts the caption\u2019s mention of solid vs. dashed lines. The legend overlaps data in some panels. The metric name 'Alignment' is inconsistent with the caption\u2019s 'MMAS.' Consider overlaying train/val in single plots or updating the caption, ensuring legends are unobtrusive, and standardizing metric names.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption misstates the plotting style (no dashed validation curves), uses an undefined term 'MMAS' instead of 'Alignment,' and offers an imprecise takeaway. It should accurately describe the layout, standardize metric names, and concisely highlight that higher learning rates accelerate loss reduction but can temporarily hurt alignment before saturation.",
        "Figrefs_review": "There are no proper references or discussion of Figure 4 in the main text (placeholder []). The manuscript should explicitly cite the figure, explain its purpose, and interpret the results (e.g., impact of learning rate on convergence speed and alignment behavior)."

        "Img_review": "The figure contains no plotted data, axes, labels, or legend, so it fails to convey any information. It appears to be a placeholder. To improve, the authors should include the actual performance curve showing alignment scores over epochs, label the axes (e.g., 'Epoch' and 'Alignment Score'), add a legend if multiple conditions are shown, and ensure the figure file is correctly loaded.",
        "Caption_review": "The caption claims a 'sharp rise epoch 1\u20132, then plateau,' but the figure does not show any such trend. The caption is misleading and lacks detail on the metric and axis ranges. It should be updated to match a real plot or replaced once the correct figure is provided.",
        "Figrefs_review": "There are no in-text references or descriptive context for this figure (the reference list is empty). The main text should explicitly refer to Figure 5, explain what 'alignment improvement' means, and discuss the observed trends in the actual plot."

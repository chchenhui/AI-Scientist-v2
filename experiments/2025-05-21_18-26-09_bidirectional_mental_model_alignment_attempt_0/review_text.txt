    "Summary": "The paper introduces CAMMA, a closed-loop framework to jointly infer a user\u2019s mental model of an AI (Q) and the AI\u2019s model of the user (P), uses Jensen\u2013Shannon divergence to define a Mutual Model Alignment Score (MMAS), and demonstrates via synthetic MLP pilots and a dropout ablation on Dbpedia14 that MMAS quickly saturates, obscuring misalignments.",
    "Strengths": [
        "Addresses an important problem of mutual mental\u2010model alignment in human\u2013AI collaboration.",
        "Simple closed\u2010loop concept emphasizing bidirectional adaptation.",
        "Highlights practical pitfall: proxy\u2010based alignment metrics can saturate."
    ],
    "Weaknesses": [
        "Core metric (MMAS) is a direct application of JSD\u2014no novel theoretical insight.",
        "Key components are underspecified: how Q(u|x) is elicited, how inverse IRL is performed, and how intervention policies are chosen.",
        "Experiments are purely proxy\u2010based (synthetic pilots and dropout ablation) with no human subjects or real\u2010world tasks.",
        "No baseline comparisons, ablation, or quantification of actual alignment improvements.",
        "Paper is extremely brief; many details relegated to appendices or omitted entirely.",
        "Lacks significance\u2014no demonstration of actual benefit in human\u2013AI settings."

    "Questions": [
        "How exactly is the user\u2019s belief distribution Q(u|x) inferred from feedback? Please specify elicitation protocols.",
        "What inverse\u2010IRL method is used to update P(u|x)? Give algorithmic details and assumptions.",
        "How are intervention policies designed and what is the cost tradeoff model?",
        "Can you compare MMAS against any existing alignment or trust metrics on a standard benchmark?",
        "What ablations or baselines demonstrate the efficacy of the closed\u2010loop over one\u2010way adaptation?"
    ],
    "Limitations": [
        "No human subjects or real\u2010task evaluation\u2014results may not transfer to true human\u2013AI collaboration.",
        "Reliance on proxy metrics that saturate; no alternative measures validated.",
        "Underspecified methodology prevents reproduction.",
        "Potential for misleading conclusions if MMAS used out of context."

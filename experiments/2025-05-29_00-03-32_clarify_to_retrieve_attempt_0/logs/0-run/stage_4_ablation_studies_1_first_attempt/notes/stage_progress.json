  "current_findings": "### Comprehensive Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Clarification Efficiency**: Successful experiments consistently demonstrated that clarification steps effectively resolved ambiguities in datasets like AmbigQA. The Clarification Efficiency Score (CES) was a reliable metric for measuring the effectiveness of clarification processes, particularly in ambiguous datasets.\n\n- **Ablation Studies**: Various ablation studies, such as Clarification Turn Budget, Always-Ask Clarification, and Confidence-Threshold Clarification, provided insights into how different strategies and parameters affect the clarification process. These studies highlighted the importance of balancing the number of clarification turns with accuracy improvements.\n\n- **Noise and Retrieval Handling**: Experiments like Ambiguity Detection Noise and Post-Clarification Retrieval Noise successfully simulated real-world scenarios where noise impacts retrieval accuracy. These experiments showed that even with noise, clarification could significantly improve accuracy, especially in ambiguous datasets.\n\n- **Iterative and Single Clarification**: Experiments that compared iterative versus single clarification strategies revealed that iterative approaches could yield higher clarification accuracy and CES, particularly in datasets with inherent ambiguity like AmbigQA.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Incorrect Data Handling**: Many failed experiments were due to incorrect handling of dataset schemas, particularly with AmbigQA. Functions like `get_gt()` often failed to extract the correct ground-truth answers, leading to artificially inflated accuracy metrics.\n\n- **Noise Injection Issues**: Several experiments struggled with effectively injecting noise into single-token answers, resulting in unchanged clarification accuracy. This was due to the noise mechanism not being robust enough to handle various answer formats.\n\n- **Parameter Integration**: Some ablation studies, such as Retrieval Size Ablation, failed to integrate key parameters (e.g., retrieval size `k`) into the simulation logic, resulting in no variation in metrics across different settings.\n\n- **Clarification Logic**: In some cases, the clarification logic mirrored baseline accuracy without showing improvements, particularly for non-AmbigQA datasets. This was due to a lack of differentiation in how noise and clarification were handled.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Data Schema Handling**: Ensure that functions for extracting ground-truth answers are tailored to the specific dataset schemas. This includes updating functions like `get_gt()` to handle dataset-specific fields and adding fallbacks for empty returns.\n\n- **Enhanced Noise Injection**: Develop more robust noise injection mechanisms that can handle single-token answers and introduce character-level corruption. This will ensure that noise impacts are accurately reflected in baseline and clarification accuracies.\n\n- **Parameter Utilization**: Integrate ablation parameters into simulation logic effectively. For example, ensure that retrieval size `k` affects retrieval accuracy and clarification outcomes, providing meaningful insights into parameter impacts.\n\n- **Clarification Strategy Diversification**: Explore a wider range of clarification strategies, such as multi-turn clarifications, to understand their impact on datasets with varying levels of ambiguity. This can help optimize clarification processes for different types of questions.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Continue to track a wide range of metrics, including baseline accuracy, clarification accuracy, average turns, and CES, to provide a holistic view of experiment outcomes. This will aid in identifying areas for improvement and success patterns.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successful and failed experiments, future research can enhance the effectiveness and reliability of clarification processes in QA systems."

  "current_findings": "### Summary of Experimental Progress\n\n#### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Static Analysis and Auto-Repair**: Successful experiments consistently incorporated static analysis and auto-repair mechanisms, particularly for handling division-by-zero errors. By automatically rewriting unsafe operations, such as converting \"a/b\" into \"a/b if b != 0 else 0\", the experiments achieved high error-free generation rates.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as adjusting learning rates and embedding dimensions, contributed to improved performance. For instance, lower learning rates and larger embedding dimensions generally resulted in lower training and validation losses.\n\n- **Structured Experimentation**: Successful experiments followed a structured approach, logging metrics like training/validation losses and error-free rates, and storing results in organized data structures. This facilitated easy analysis and comparison across different runs.\n\n- **Use of Synthetic Tasks**: Starting with a small-scale synthetic task allowed for controlled experimentation and quick iterations, leading to a better understanding of model behavior and performance.\n\n#### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **ZeroDivisionError**: Many failed experiments encountered ZeroDivisionError due to unguarded division operations in the evaluation function. This was a recurring issue that needed consistent handling across experiments.\n\n- **Flawed Evaluation Logic**: Several experiments had flawed evaluation logic where the model's predictions were not used, leading to misleadingly high error-free rates. The evaluation function often defaulted to using ground-truth IDs instead of the model's predicted outputs.\n\n- **Dataset Loading Errors**: Errors in loading datasets, such as specifying non-existent configurations or incorrect dataset names, led to execution failures. Proper validation of dataset configurations is necessary.\n\n- **Inconsistent Integration of New Datasets**: Despite intentions to integrate new datasets like those from HuggingFace, several experiments failed to do so, limiting the scope of evaluation and generalization.\n\n#### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Error Handling**: Implement consistent and robust error handling for division operations, ensuring that all potential division-by-zero cases are safely managed. This can be achieved by mirroring the generated code's guard logic in the evaluation function.\n\n- **Accurate Evaluation**: Ensure that the evaluation logic accurately reflects the model's performance by using the model's predicted outputs rather than defaulting to ground-truth values. This will provide a more realistic assessment of the model's capabilities.\n\n- **Comprehensive Hyperparameter Exploration**: Continue systematic hyperparameter tuning, exploring a wider range of values and combinations. This includes experimenting with batch sizes, learning rates, and other model-specific parameters like dropout rates and optimizer settings.\n\n- **Dataset Validation and Integration**: Validate dataset configurations before running experiments and ensure that new datasets are correctly integrated into the training and evaluation pipeline. This will enhance the robustness and applicability of the results.\n\n- **Documentation and Logging**: Maintain detailed documentation and logging of each experiment's setup, execution, and outcomes. This will facilitate troubleshooting, replication, and iterative improvement.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations and learning from both successes and failures, future experiments can achieve more reliable and generalizable results."

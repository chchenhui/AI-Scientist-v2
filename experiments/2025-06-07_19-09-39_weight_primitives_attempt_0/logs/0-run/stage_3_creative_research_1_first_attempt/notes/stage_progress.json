  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: The successful experiments demonstrated the effectiveness of hyperparameter tuning, particularly with the Adam optimizer's \u03b2\u2081 parameter. A systematic grid search over different \u03b2\u2081 values led to varied performance outcomes, with \u03b2\u2081=0.99 yielding the best results in terms of training and validation errors and losses.\n\n- **Consistent Metrics Tracking**: Successful experiments consistently tracked key metrics such as training and validation errors and losses. This allowed for a clear comparison of performance across different hyperparameter settings and facilitated the identification of optimal configurations.\n\n- **Comprehensive Data Logging**: Storing all metrics, losses, predictions, and ground truths in a structured format (e.g., numpy arrays) enabled thorough analysis and reproducibility of results.\n\n- **Self-Contained Scripts**: The successful experiments were self-contained and executable as-is, ensuring that all necessary components were included and correctly configured.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Dataset Loading Errors**: A recurring issue was the incorrect specification of dataset names or configurations, leading to DatasetNotFoundError or ValueError. This was particularly evident with the SVHN and KMNIST datasets.\n\n- **Incorrect Data Transformations**: Several failures were due to incorrect assumptions about the data format, such as expecting PIL Images when the datasets provided raw pixel values or lists. This led to AttributeErrors and TypeErrors.\n\n- **Missing Dependencies**: Some experiments failed due to missing dependencies, such as scikit-learn, resulting in ModuleNotFoundError. This highlights the importance of ensuring all necessary libraries are installed and available.\n\n- **Key Errors in Data Handling**: Incorrect assumptions about dataset features, such as expecting a 'label' key when the dataset used 'fine_label' or 'coarse_label', resulted in KeyErrors.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Dataset Handling**: Implement checks to ensure that datasets are correctly specified and loaded. For example, dynamically detect available configurations and handle dataset-specific features to avoid KeyErrors.\n\n- **Flexible Data Transformations**: Ensure that data transformation pipelines are robust to different data formats. Convert raw data to the expected format (e.g., PIL Images or NumPy arrays) before applying transformations.\n\n- **Dependency Management**: Include a self-install step for critical dependencies at the beginning of scripts to prevent ModuleNotFoundError. Consider using virtual environments or containerization to manage dependencies consistently.\n\n- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implement error handling mechanisms to catch and provide informative messages for common issues like missing datasets or incorrect data formats. This will aid in quicker debugging and resolution.\n\n- **Iterative Hyperparameter Optimization**: Continue leveraging systematic hyperparameter tuning, as it has proven effective in optimizing model performance. Consider using automated tools for hyperparameter optimization to streamline the process.\n\n- **Thorough Documentation and Logging**: Maintain detailed documentation of experimental setups and ensure comprehensive logging of all relevant metrics and configurations. This will facilitate reproducibility and ease of analysis.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on past successes and avoid common pitfalls, leading to more robust and efficient experimental workflows."

  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Optimization Pipeline**: Successful experiments consistently utilized a well-structured optimization pipeline that included joint optimization of dictionary and sparse codes with L2 reconstruction loss and L1 sparsity penalty. This approach effectively reduced both training and validation errors.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic hyperparameter tuning, such as learning rate, weight decay, and Adam optimizer parameters (\u03b2\u2081 and \u03b2\u2082), significantly improved model performance. For instance, tuning learning rates and weight decay led to reduced training and validation errors.\n\n- **Metric Tracking and Data Management**: Successful experiments implemented robust metric tracking and data management strategies, storing results in structured nested dictionaries and saving them in a consistent format (e.g., `experiment_data.npy`). This facilitated easy analysis and comparison of results across different runs.\n\n- **Component Variation**: Experiments that varied the number of components (n_components) demonstrated the impact of model complexity on performance, with smaller component sizes generally yielding better validation errors.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Improper Dataset Handling**: Several failed experiments encountered issues with dataset handling, particularly when slicing or iterating over HuggingFace datasets. Incorrect assumptions about dataset structure led to errors like TypeError and AttributeError.\n\n- **Dependency Issues**: Missing dependencies, such as the absence of scikit-learn for Lasso regression, caused experiments to fail. Ensuring all necessary libraries are installed and available is crucial.\n\n- **Inadequate Hyperparameter Influence**: In some cases, hyperparameter sweeps did not influence the results due to improper integration of the hyperparameter into the model (e.g., \u03bb\u2081 not affecting validation error because of the use of pseudoinverse instead of solving the sparse coding problem).\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Robust Dataset Handling**: Ensure proper handling of datasets by using appropriate slicing and iteration methods. Utilize functions like `Dataset.select` and `set_format` to maintain compatibility with different dataset structures and column names.\n\n- **Dependency Management**: Verify that all required dependencies are installed before running experiments. Consider using virtual environments or containerization to manage dependencies consistently.\n\n- **Effective Hyperparameter Integration**: Ensure that hyperparameters are effectively integrated into the model training process. For instance, when using sparsity penalties, solve the sparse coding problem directly rather than relying on approximations like the pseudoinverse.\n\n- **Comprehensive Metric Tracking**: Continue using structured data management for metrics and results. This facilitates easier analysis and comparison across different experimental runs and hyperparameter settings.\n\n- **Expand Dataset Variety**: Incorporate a wider variety of datasets, including image datasets, to test the generalizability of the models. Ensure preprocessing steps are adaptable to different dataset formats and structures.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve more robust and insightful results."

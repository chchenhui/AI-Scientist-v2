  "current_findings": "### 1. Key Patterns of Success Across Working Experiments\n\n- **Synthetic Data Baseline**: The use of synthetic data to simulate perturbation-induced uncertainty has proven effective in establishing a solid baseline for hallucination detection. The consistent high AUC scores (e.g., Training AUC of 0.9505 and Validation AUC of 0.9572) indicate that the model can effectively distinguish between \"correct\" and \"hallucinated\" examples.\n\n- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematic exploration of hyperparameters such as `adam_beta1` and `lr_scheduler_gamma` has shown improvements in model performance. For example, tuning `adam_beta1` resulted in a validation accuracy of 0.9572, and tuning `lr_scheduler_gamma` maintained high validation AUCs.\n\n- **Use of Real-World Datasets**: Integrating real-world datasets like SST-2 and Yelp Polarity, alongside synthetic data, has allowed for broader validation of the model's performance. Although the accuracy on these datasets is lower than on synthetic data, the experiments provide valuable insights into the model's generalization capabilities.\n\n- **Consistent Data Handling**: The successful experiments consistently use PyTorch DataLoaders for managing train and validation splits, ensuring that data is efficiently fed into the model during training.\n\n### 2. Common Failure Patterns and Pitfalls to Avoid\n\n- **Gradient-to-NumPy Conversion Errors**: A recurring issue in failed experiments is attempting to convert tensors that require gradients to NumPy arrays without detaching them first. This results in `RuntimeError` crashes.\n\n- **Incorrect Dataset Identifiers**: Several experiments failed due to incorrect dataset identifiers, such as using \"ieee_fraud_detection\" instead of the correct \"creditcard.\" This led to `DatasetNotFoundError`.\n\n- **Lack of Dataset Availability**: Attempting to use datasets not available in the HuggingFace library, such as OpenML datasets, resulted in failures due to missing integration or incorrect loading methods.\n\n### 3. Specific Recommendations for Future Experiments\n\n- **Ensure Proper Tensor Conversion**: Always detach tensors from the computation graph before converting them to NumPy arrays. Use `torch.sigmoid(logits).detach().cpu().numpy()` to avoid runtime errors.\n\n- **Verify Dataset Availability**: Before using a dataset, verify its availability and correct identifier in the HuggingFace library. Consider wrapping dataset loading in a try/except block to handle potential errors gracefully.\n\n- **Expand Hyperparameter Search**: Continue exploring a wider range of hyperparameters beyond those already tested (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes) to further optimize model performance.\n\n- **Leverage Real-World Data**: Incorporate more real-world datasets to test the model's robustness and generalization capabilities. Ensure that these datasets are correctly loaded and preprocessed.\n\n- **Document and Save Experiment Data**: Maintain a structured approach to saving experiment data, including metrics, predictions, and configurations, to facilitate downstream analysis and replication.\n\nBy addressing these recommendations, future experiments can build on the successes and learn from the failures to achieve more robust and reliable outcomes."

We load three HuggingFace datasets (PG19, Scientific Papers ArXiv, and WikiText\u20102) and subsample them for quick prototyping; each text is mapped to a byte\u2010level token stream by character ordinals mod 256. Our ImprovedMemoryTransformerLayer computes per\u2010head entropies, merges them into a scalar per\u2010token score, and retains the top\u2010k highest\u2010entropy tokens. We train and validate for two epochs per dataset, tracking validation loss and the novel Entropy\u2010Weighted Memory Efficiency (sum of retained token entropies divided by slots used), as well as overall Memory Retention Ratio. All metrics and losses are stored in a nested `experiment_data` dict and saved as a numpy file; validation loss is printed each epoch.

This adaptive budget allows the model to flexibly prune low-novelty slots and preserve salient context. We integrate this layer into a Transformer-XL style LM and benchmark on three HuggingFace language-modeling datasets: PG19, arXiv (scientific_papers), and Wikitext-103. Each corpus is tokenized with the GPT-2 tokenizer, chunked into sliding-window blocks, and fed via small batches with chunked forward passes to trigger dynamic compression. We log validation loss (perplexity proxy) each epoch, compute an Entropy-Weighted Memory Efficiency metric (mean entropy preserved per slot), and save all losses and metrics for later analysis. This setup will reveal whether entropy-thresholding yields better long-range retention and efficiency across diverse long-text sources.","overall_plan":"","plot_code":null,"plot_plan":null,"step":2,"id":"90cac1a52c8b4a14a32fef1eb3b5a977","ctime":1749139704.5022585,"_term_out":["Using device: cuda","\n","\n=== Dataset: pg19 ===","\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"runfile.py\", line 126, in <module>\n    ds = load_dataset(name, split=\"train[:1%]\")\n         ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/load.py\", line 2084, in load_dataset\n    builder_instance.download_and_prepare(\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/builder.py\", line 860, in download_and_prepare\n    with FileLock(lock_path) if is_local else contextlib.nullcontext():\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/filelock/_api.py\", line 376, in __enter__\n    self.acquire()\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/filelock/_api.py\", line 344, in acquire\n    time.sleep(poll_interval)\nKeyboardInterrupt\n","TimeoutError: Execution exceeded the time limit of an hour"],"parse_metrics_plan":"","parse_metrics_code":"","parse_term_out":null,"parse_exc_type":null,"parse_exc_info":null,"parse_exc_stack":null,"exec_time":3600.819195508957,"exc_type":"TimeoutError","exc_info":{"args":[]},"exc_stack":[["/home/chenhui/AI-Scientist-v2/ai_scientist/treesearch/interpreter.py",144,"_run_session","exec(compile(code, self.agent_file_name, \"exec\"), global_scope)"],["runfile.py",126,"<module>","ds = load_dataset(name, split=\"train[:1%]\")"],["/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/load.py",2084,"load_dataset","builder_instance.download_and_prepare("],["/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/builder.py",860,"download_and_prepare","with FileLock(lock_path) if is_local else contextlib.nullcontext():"],["/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/filelock/_api.py",376,"__enter__","self.acquire()"],["/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/filelock/_api.py",344,"acquire","time.sleep(poll_interval)"]],"analysis":"The script hung and timed out when calling load_dataset('pg19', split='train[:1%]') because load_dataset still tries to download and prepare the entire PG19 dataset before yielding even 1% of data.

Each dataset is sampled to a small curated split of 20 sequences of 128 tokens for fast prototyping, and split equally into train and validation sets. We maintain the Entropy\u2010Aware Adaptive Compressive Memory module, but augment it to compute the Entropy\u2010Weighted Memory Efficiency (EWME) metric\u2014i.e. average self\u2010attention entropy per retained slot\u2014at each forward pass. We train a lightweight MemoryTransformerXL model for 2 epochs per dataset, tracking train/val losses and EWME per epoch. For qualitative analysis, we generate one autoregressive sample per validation set and plot predicted vs. ground\u2010truth tokens, saving figures under working_dir with unique names. All tensors, models, and computations are properly moved to GPU when available. Finally, we serialize the full experiment_data structure (including metrics, predictions, and ground truth) as a NumPy file.

Each dataset is subsampled to 200 train and 50 validation examples, and turned into PyTorch DataLoaders. We reuse the MemoryTransformerLayer to compute per-token attention entropy and adaptively compress the KV buffer, returning entropies for metric tracking. A light TransformerXLModel (embed_dim=128, 4 heads) is trained for one epoch on each dataset, with chunking (32 tokens) to simulate long-context processing. At every epoch we compute and print the validation loss and the average Entropy-Weighted Memory Efficiency (total retained entropy divided by memory slots). After training on each corpus, we generate sample continuations from the first validation sequence, plot predicted vs. ground truth token IDs, and save the figures. All losses, metrics, predictions, and ground truths are stored in an `experiment_data` dict keyed by dataset, then saved as a NumPy file in the working directory.","overall_plan":"","plot_code":null,"plot_plan":null,"step":8,"id":"d5c4d3a380234ec1a5de2b854e2918e9","ctime":1749144802.7548623,"_term_out":["Using device: cuda","\n","\rMap:   0%|          | 0/200 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","","\rMap:   0%|          | 0/200 [00:00<?, ? examples/s]","\n","Traceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"runfile.py\", line 130, in <module>\n    train_loader, val_loader, train_ds, val_ds = get_dataloaders(\n                                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"runfile.py\", line 89, in get_dataloaders\n    ds_train = ds_train.map(tok_fn, batched=True, remove_columns=ds_train.column_names)\n               ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/arrow_dataset.py\", line 557, in wrapper\n    out: Union[\"Dataset\", \"DatasetDict\"] = func(self, *args, **kwargs)\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/arrow_dataset.py\", line 3079, in map\n    for rank, done, content in Dataset._map_single(**dataset_kwargs):\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/arrow_dataset.py\", line 3525, in _map_single\n    for i, batch in iter_outputs(shard_iterable):\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/arrow_dataset.py\", line 3475, in iter_outputs\n    yield i, apply_function(example, i, offset=offset)\n             ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/datasets/arrow_dataset.py\", line 3398, in apply_function\n    processed_inputs = function(*fn_args, *additional_args, **fn_kwargs)\n                       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"runfile.py\", line 85, in tok_fn\n    return tokenizer(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py\", line 2867, in __call__\n    encodings = self._call_one(text=text, text_pair=text_pair, **all_kwargs)\n                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py\", line 2955, in _call_one\n    return self.batch_encode_plus(\n           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py\", line 3147, in batch_encode_plus\n    padding_strategy, truncation_strategy, max_length, kwargs = self._get_padding_truncation_strategies(\n                                                                ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\n  File \"/home/chenhui/miniconda3/envs/ai_scientist/lib/python3.11/site-packages/transformers/tokenization_utils_base.py\", line 2769, in _get_padding_truncation_strategies\n    raise ValueError(\nValueError: Asking to pad but the tokenizer does not have a padding token.

This Gated Entropy\u2010Aware Memory (GEAM) module replaces fixed selection by computing a retention score via a small MLP whose input is the embedding and entropy of each token. At each step when memory exceeds the budget, we rank tokens by the product of entropy and the learned gate sigmoid, keeping the top slots. We integrate this GEAM layer into a Transformer\u2010XL backbone and evaluate on three HuggingFace streaming datasets: PG19, scientific_papers/arxiv, and wikitext\u20102\u2010raw. We track validation loss, Memory Retention Ratio, and Entropy\u2010Weighted Memory Efficiency at every epoch and save all metrics. This learned gating can adapt to different data distributions, potentially preserving more task\u2010relevant context than pure entropy ranking.

Wikitext-2-raw-v1 achieves the lowest losses, going from ~2.4 to ~1.4 in training and from ~1.5 to ~1.35 in validation, suggesting the model learns this dataset more quickly or that its content is easier to predict.

Scientific Papers ArXiv sees the steepest decline (train: 3.83\u21923.68, val: 3.72\u21923.67), suggesting that entropy-guided compression is less efficient for this domain over the same budget.
